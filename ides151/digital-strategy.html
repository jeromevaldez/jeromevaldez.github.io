      	<h1>Digital Media Strategy</h1>
      	<p>Media strategy, as used in the <strong>advertising industry</strong>, is concerned with <strong>how messages will be delivered to consumers</strong>. It involves: identifying the <strong>characteristics of the target audience</strong>, who should receive messages and defining the characteristics of the media that will be used for the delivery of the messages, with <strong>the intent being to influence the behaviour of the target audience</strong> pertinent to the initial brief. (from Wikipedia, emphasis mine)</p>
      	<p>More simply - <strong>how can we best deliver our message to our target audience?</strong></p>
      	<p>What types of media are we talking about?</p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Television</li>
      		<li>Radio</li>
      		<li>Direct Mail</li>
      		<li>Newspaper</li>
      		<li>Magazine</li>
      		<li>Billboards</li>
      		<li>Street/Guerilla Marketing</li>
      		<li>Posters</li>
      		<li>Email</li>
      		<li>Web</li>
      		<li>Mobile</li>
      		<li>Environmental Design</li>
      		<li>Augmented Reality</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>When we are thinking of our target audience and their context, we seek to answer questions such as:</p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Who is our audience? Are they old or young? Are they tech savvy or afraid of new technologies? Are they male or female?</li>
      		<li>Where did they come from? This question attempts to uncover the possible chain of events that would lead people to come across our work. For example, if we have designed a website, how do we expect people to know about it? via TV? via posters? word of mouth? Facebook? Twitter? Reddit? Google?</li>
      		<li>Where will they encounter our message? Will people see our message while they are on the go with their mobile device? Will they be relaxing at home on the couch? Will they be at work?</li>
      		<li>When will they likely see our message? Daytime? Night? During a meal? Over a weekend vs. at work?</li>
      		<li>What is their frame of mind when they see our message? Will people be in a frenzy? Will people be relaxed and open to suggestion?</li>
      		<li>What do we want them to do/think/feel when they see our message? This is one or the most important questions to answer. What is the ultimate outcome that we desire from our communications?</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>Answering the questions above will affect the content and the design of the content. We can alter how loud the design needs to be. We can alter the density of detail of the information. We can control the timing of our communications.</p>
      	<h2>Let's look at some examples</h2>
      	<h3>VW Fun Theory</h3>
      	<p>This campaign combined environmental design and social media.</p>
      	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2lXh2n0aPyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      	<br />
      	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zSiHjMU-MUo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      	<h3>IKEA's Facebook Showroom</h3>
      	<p>A contest that used Facebook's tagging feature to spread the message.</p>
      	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0TYy_3786bo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      	<h3>Burger King's Whopper Sacrifice</h3>
      	<p><img src="img/whopper-sacrifice.jpg" alt="Whopper Sacrifice" class="img-responsive" /></p>
      	<p>People were asked to 'unfriend' 10 Facebook friends. In return, they would receive a Whopper ($2 coupon). Victims were notified that they were sacrificed for a burger. The campaign was a huge success and generated plenty of buzz for Burger King. It was, however, eventually taken down by Facebook for privacy reasons: you are not supposed to see who removes you as a friend. By the end of the campaign, over 200,000 people were sacrificed. Incidentally, one friend was worth about 20 cents.</p>
