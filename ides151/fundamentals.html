          <h1>Fundamental Principles in UX Design</h1>
          <h2>User Feedback</h2>
          <p>When a user interacts with your site. Your app or site should give feedback that acknowledges the interaction and that your system is reacting in kind. How quickly should your feedback show up? Milliseconds, otherwise the experience feels broken.</p>
          <h2>Get over yourself</h2>
          <p>If you find yourself rationalizing your designs with ‘I think…’ a lot, then your should start testing your designs with other people who are not you. This includes testing work in progress. As a designer, you are solving problems for others (your clients, your clients’ audience) and not yourself. You’ll need to exercise empathy to do this well.</p>
          <h2>Grouping Elements</h2>
          <p>Make things that belong together look like they belong together via layout, borders, backgrounds.</p>
          <h2>Hierarcy of Elements</h2>
          <p>Clarify which things are ‘parents’ or ‘children’ or ‘siblings’ of other things. Do this via layout indentation, size, contrast, borders, backgrounds.</p>
          <h2>Overview - Scan - Details on Demand</h2>
          <p>This information design model allows users to dig into as much detail as they want without being overwhelmed with the volume of detail right away.</p>
          <h2>The less a site is revisited or used, the lower the information density you should aim for</h2>
          <p>For example, compare Strava and Mint’s marketing sites to their actual online applications.</p>
          <h2>Don’t fear high information density for UX that is frequently used</h2>
          <p>If you have a product that is used daily or multiple times a day, then you can afford to have high information density in the UI because your users will become accustomed to the location of the menus and buttons and overall usability of your tool.</p>
          <h2>Avoid jargon. Don’t be too cute or clever with your menu or buttons or headings.</h2>
          <p>It’s tempting to try to innovate, but save your innovations for other parts of your site. From ‘Don’t Make Me Think’ - avoid choosing button labels or menu items that cause confusion for your users who are trying to find something or accomplish a task.</p>
          <h2>Keep your animations and metaphors consistent</h2>
          <p>For example, if you swipe one direction to go somewhere, then have the user swipe the opposite direction to go back, and avoid a different animation (e.g. flip or fade) to go back. Keep the animations and metaphors consistent when you’re animating transitions.</p>
          <h2>If your audience needs to read your UI, then make it readable</h2>
          <p>Don’t make your audience squint to read your content or your UI that contains text.</p>
          <h2>Beware iconography - it’s either ‘universal’ or it’s frequently used</h2>
          <p>Not many icons are universal to a broad user base. New icons need frequent use to be understood without text. For new designers, it’s better to stick with well-known icons in your UI designs.</p>
          <h2>Don’t fear the familiar</h2>
          <p>It’s ok to make your UX recognizable enough, or evocative of other interfaces that your audience is familiar with. Don’t over-innovate or try to be overly-clever because that sometimes results in a UI that is so foreign that it’s difficult to learn and use. This doesn’t mean you should break copyrights though.</p>
          <h2>Know thy interactions, especially with mobile</h2>
          <p>This is particularly important when designing for mobile. For mobile designs, get comfortable with the physical interactions of swipes, taps, pinches. And if you’re designing for an operating system you’re not familiar with, then put in the work to get familiar with the common interactions of that platform. The same is true for Windows vs. Mac interactions.</p>
