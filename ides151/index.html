        <!-- Introduction
        =============================== -->
        
	    
    	<h1>This is a User Experience (UX) course</h1>
    	<p>This material is meant to teach the practice of being a user experience professional as I see it. It's meant to cover the basic theories that are core to the profession. There are sections which explain the documents that are normally produced by UX professionals. I have stayed away from specific tools because you should focus more on the core concepts first.</p>
    	<p>I hope to continually refine what you see here in order to make it more timely, more useful, and more practical. Some links and videos might be broken. Let me know if you see something that confuses you, or that you disagree with completely - it makes for a great discussion over coffee or a beer.</p>
    	<p>I enjoy teaching this material, and I hope you get something out of it too.</p>
   
       	<h1>Introduction and Expectations</h1>
    	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
    	<img src="img/uncle-sam.png" class="img-responsive" />
    	<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
    	<p>Enough about you; let's talk about me. My career looks like this: Human Resources &mdash; IT &mdash; Blast Radius &mdash; Startup &mdash; Freelance (Teaching) &mdash; iQmetrix (Teaching). I have been in the web industry since 2000. I have worked for clients such as...</p>
    	<p><img src="img/client-logos.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
    	<h2>What do you expect from this material?</h2>
    	<p>Do you have great expectations?<br /><img src="img/great-expectations.jpg" /></p>
    	<h2>What do I expect you to get out of it?</h2>
    	<p>We are here to learn about the field of user experience. We will learn how to gather and analyze some information. We will use tools to organize it all. Then we'll create digital design documents to plan what and how to build our digital experiences. Oh, and it's mostly for websites. But not always.</p>
    	<p>We can make it even simpler...<br /><img src="img/suck-less.png" /></p>
    	<p>How are going to suck less? By looking at a lot of user experiences.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/lots-of-websites.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
    	<h2>Concepts vs. aesthetics</h2>
    	<p>This course is not primarily about the aesthetics of your websites/digital branding work. This course is about concepts of usability, good navigation principles, information design (including hierarchies that you would normally see on site maps and schematics), how to communicate priority of information on a screen. That said, if your designs have some serious aesthetic flaws in my opinion, then I will give you that as part of my critiques. I'll definitely point out when the aesthetic choices start affecting usability and the user experience.</p>
    	<h2>What should you expect from me?</h2>
    	<p>I will aim to deliver the material in a clear, and informative way. When explaining a concept, I will always try to pull in my experience in the industry, or I will reference the experiences of others (including yourselves). This material is not theoretical - it is applied. And the best way to teach applied material, in my opinion, is to tell stories from the working world.</p>
    	<p>I will aim to be available to answer questions not only when we are together, but in virtual space too. I sometimes do this with video chats (Google Hangouts for example) or email.</p>
    	<h2>What I expect from you</h2>
    	<h3>Be on time</h3>
    	<p>This shows that we respect each other. It's important.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/homer-clock.png" /></p>
    	<h3>Participate</h3>
    	<p>You and your peers and I will all get more out of this experience if you participate. You paid good money to be here. The best way to get the most value for that money is to participate.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/doing-nothing.png" /></p>
    	<h3>Spelling and grammar matter</h3>
    	<p>How do I feel about typos and spelling errors? Many other people have summarized my feelings on the issue. Let's look at a few...</p>
    	<p>Regarding typos:<a href="http://graphicpush.com/your-design-portfolio-has-10-mistakes"> Your Design Portfolio Has 10 Mistakes</a> (see number 9)</p>  
    	<p>Regarding spelling errors: <a href="http://iampaddy.com/spell/">Learn Too F***ing Spell</a>
    	<p>Here is a series of Oatmeal cartoons that should help you write in English:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apostrophe">Using an apostrophe</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally">Using "literally"</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon">Semicolons</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ie">Using "i.e."</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/misspelling">Misspelling</a></li>
    	</ul>  
    	<h3>Deadlines matter</h3>
    	<p>I will be clear as to when an assignment is due. One day late results in a 10% penalty. Two days late results in a 20% penalty. Three days late results in a mark of zero.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/what-late-means1.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
    	<p>Perhaps one more diagram will make it clearer. Let's pretend that you are accustomed to earing 70% on assignments, and the next one is due on a Friday at 2pm.</p>
    	<p><img src="img/what-late-means2.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
    	<h3>Fail fast. Fail cheap. Fail often</h3>
    	<p>This means that you should come and show me work in progress. You should ask me questions as you work through problems. But I cannot make you do this. I am assuming you are a grown up and will make this happen on your own. I will remind you that it’s a good idea though. You’ll learn more and your marks will improve.</p>
    	<h3>Mostly, I expect you to put in effort</h3>
    	<p>Here is Elizabeth Gilbert talking about it</p>
