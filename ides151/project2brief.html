            <h1>Project 2: Information Architecture</h1>
            <h3>Due: March 21st at the start of class 9am.</h3>
            <p>Use Adobe Muse to create two different sites. The first will reflect the information architecture of the current website. The second will show what you recommend as a new information architecture. You'll use the same website as the subject for both.</p>
            <p>One example website in class was The Old Spaghetti Factory. Other possible candidate website for this project were written in Slack. If you have an alternative restaurant website, please run it by me for approval first. The website should have between 20-30 pages minimum and should have some depth to the information architecture. In other words, there should be some clear child-parent relationships between the pages. It should go at least two levels deep and it can go deeper than that.</p>
            <p>The Muse pages should include a navigation/menu bar. The pages do not have to be completely designed with full content on them, but they should have some text or title on each page that shows which page is being viewed. We did this in our class exercise when we wrote "This is the Product page" or "This is the Beer Archive page". </p>
            <p>Your second Muse site showing the recommended information architecture should still be able to incorporate all of the content of the original site. You can reorganize it and combine content onto one page, but you should not be removing any content that was on the original.</p>
            <p>What I'll be looking for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your assignment is handed in as a URL. You'll point to a server that you've set up on your host. For example http://yourdomain.com/ides151/project2/</li>
                <li>The current information architecture reflects the real site and is not missing any key content. Watch out for sneaky content that is not obvious or in the main navigation. This includes Privacy pages, Terms and Conditions, and even Thank You pages for websites that have forms that users submit.</li>
                <li>The new recommendations that you put forward are an improvement to the information architecture. The recommendations should not make it harder to find content or more confusing to the users.</li>
                <li>If you make changes to combine or add content, then you should provide a written rationale about why you made those changes. You can submit this in a simple written document.</li>
                <li>Your new recommended information architecture is not missing any content that the original site had.</li>
            </ul>
