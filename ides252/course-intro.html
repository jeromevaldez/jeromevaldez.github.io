                <h1>Course Introduction</h1>
                <p>The <a href="docs/IDES252-15.pdf">course outline is here.</a></p>
                <h2>Which digital design skills are important in the industry?</h2>
                <p>I asked around and here's what I heard...</p>
                <blockquote>In short, front end coding skills including HTML, CSS, customizing WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and other CMSs, responsive design, UI/UX, responsive HTML email design, and lots more.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>... if there’s one thing they can walk away with at the end of their time is that the user and their needs must be at the heart of everything they do. Meeting your audience where they are: environmental, desktop, hand-held, on body… these platforms are unshackling the web from traditional stationary environments and demand clear thinking about how each instance can both work in the digital world, but also have an outcome in the real world. How does technology fit into the life of your user, not the other way around. </blockquote>
                <blockquote>Design to mobile first: yes it’s taken over the web. So you need to address mobile needs first (yes, less is more); however, a more important web design for the future is a visceral design as opposed to clear and concise above all else. Storytelling is the better means for a successful future and that is being achieved with long scrolling web pages.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I would say basic HTML/CSS, FTP is mandatory, (including HTML for emails) then wordpress / customizing. Next up would be digital / social media development and integrations (not necessarily content). Then basic PHP, and hosting, name servers, cPanel etc…</blockquote>
                <blockquote>... jquery, social media integrations/functionality (not content), hosting, phpmyadmin, @records etc.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>We'd like all creatives, regardless of digital aptitude, to not be afraid of it. The tools are going to change, so nurturing a healthy curiosity about what it can do and how it can be leveraged would be beneficial.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>From a technical specific POV, our current needs, require our team to know html/css, wordpress / squarespace platforms, and some php. Starting with a mobile first attitude, is better than thinking desktop. So design for mobile first and then expanding out to desktop.</blockquote>
                <p>Let's try to get a good start on all of that, eh?</p>
                
                
                <h2>Schedule and office hours</h2>
                <p>Class runs from 9am - 4pm every Monday.</p>
                <p>My office hours are officially from 4-6pm, but you can arrange to talk to me over the lunch break or evenings with an appointment (evening appointments will be done using <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>)</p>
                <h2>Assignments and marks</h2>
                <p>You'll get quizzes and assignments. Details are in the <a href="docs/IDES252-16-final.pdf">course outline</a>.</p>
                <h2>Late assignments</h2>
                <p>Again, as per the <a href="docs/IDES252-16-final.pdf">course outline</a> ...</p>
                <blockquote>If the course contains assignments, 20% will be deducted from the assignment grade for each period of 1 to 7 days that an assignment is late, unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor.</blockquote>
                <p>I'm going with 20% per 1 day.</p>
                
                <hr>
                <h1>Setting ourselves up</h1>
                <h2>Get Chrome (if you haven't already)</h2>
                <p>Download it at <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">google.com/chrome.</a></p>
                <h2>Setup a free Google account (if you don't already have one)</h2>
                <p>You should already have a Google account because we set one up last year in my class.</p>
                <h2>Install Brackets</h2>
                <p>Brackets is a text editor that we'll use to write basic HTML, CSS, and maybe even javascript. Download it at <a href="http://brackets.io/">brackets.io.</a></p>
