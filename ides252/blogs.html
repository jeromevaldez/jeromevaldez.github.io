                <h1>Blogs</h1>
                <p>
                    Blogging comes from the terms web + log. They are public journals. The essence of blogging is writing. It's self-publishing. Blogging at it's purest requires no moderation of the author. In other words, no editors are required. Once you introduce an editing and moderating infrastructure then you start looking like a journalist writing articles. I'm trying to differentiate that activity with blogging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We should also differentiate between keeping a private journal and blogging. Once you expose your thoughts publicly on a blog, you have effectively invited an audience into your world. There is nothing wrong with a private journal (that's where plenty of blog posts come from). But a blog is a decidely public forum for the author's thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This does not mean that bloggers do not or cannot make a living from blogging. Many bloggers make a fine wage from blogging, but the process of writing and publishing is completely in their control.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <h3>Interesting content for your audience</h3>
                <p>
                    Be interesting to somebody. Bloggers usually start blogging because they can't help but express themselves. Sometimes that expression finds an audience. Sometimes that audience grows to be a very large audience. But even a small and devoted audience requires the author to create interesting content at a regular or semi-regular cadence. If you stop being interesting, you'll lose your audience. If you suffer a long drought of content, then you'll lose your audience. If you'd rather not have an audience, then maybe you should stick to a private journal (see above) and stay away from blogging.
                </p>
                <h3>Easy readability</h3>
                <p>
                    Because the primary content of a blog is words, that makes readability one of the most important visual design considerations when creating one. As is often the case with our class, we should think about the experience for both mobile and desktop users. Readability in a variety of channels and form factors is important. The fundamentals of typography apply. Type hierarchy (for headings vs. paragraphs) and legibility for long-form writing should be top of mind.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Basic Elements</h3>
                <p>For each blog post, here are the usual elements:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Post Title</li>
                    <li>Date posted</li>
                    <li>Author. If your blog is written by a single author, then this is less important.</li>
                    <li>Post content
                        <ul>
                            <li>Paragraphs</li>
                            <li>Sub-headings</li>
                            <li>Pull quotes</li>
                            <li>Sidebars</li>
                            <li>Media: Video, Audio, Images</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Blog home pages</h3>
                <p>There are a few different approaches to a blog home page:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>The latest post only</li>
                	<li>The last [x] number of posts</li>
                	<li>Show the full content of the latest posts</li>
                	<li>Show a teaser block of a full post</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Blog navigation</h3>
                <p>The common navigation patterns for blogs are:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Posts by date: by month and/or year and/or day depending on how frequently the author posts</li>
                	<li>Posts by topic: keywords, tag clouds</li>
                	<li>Previous and Next posts navigation</li>
                	<li>Also, normally people include About page to talk about the author(s).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>

                    You have a client who wants to start a food blog. She has found her niche in the relatively crowded food blogging universe in Vancouver. She’s hired you to design the blog. She is not the only author, her boyfriend also will write on the blog; sometimes they will write together.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Design a blog with:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A home page</li>
                    <li>An about page for the authors</li>
                    <li>Multiple posts on the home page (not just a single one). The order should be the latest post taking the most important spot, followed by older posts.</li>
                    <li>Links to 1 detailed posts, after clicking on a post’s title and/or a “Read More” link</li>
                    <li>Show a detailed post with a pull quote, an image (or multiple) and/or a video (or multiple). A few paragraphs of text, and some sub headings to break up the content.</li>
                    <li>Design what the comments should look like below the post.</li>
                    <li>The design should work well both on a desktop and on a smartphone</li>
                    <li>Make the titles, navigation, headings, and sub-headings realistic content (i.e. not placeholder text). But for larger paragraphs, you can use placeholder text like "Lorem Ipum …"</li>
                </ul>

                    Blog concept ideas (if you're having trouble getting started)

                    <li>Go low-end</li>
                    <li>Do a mix and match of high + low</li>
