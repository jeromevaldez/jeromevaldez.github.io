                    Reboot Movember
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Movember Foundation is looking to reboot their campaign for 2016. Since their inception, they’ve added different ways to get involved. They’ve also added some new areas of support for Men’s Health. <a href="https://ca.movember.com/about/foundation">This website</a> is where you can learn more. They have found that interest has been waning over the last few years. They need some new ideas to raise awareness and funds for men’s health.

                <h2>
                    What I'll be looking for:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You've published the site to a URL that looks like the following http://yoursite.com/ides252-final-project/ (replace "yoursite.com" with your own website).</li>
                    <li>All your links work</li>
                    <li>You have designed navigation that tell the user where she is relative to the rest of the site and where she can go.</li>
                    <li>Use of mobile-friendly or even mobile-first design. This means that it should still work well on desktops, not only mobile.</li>
                    <li>Your choices with typography and layout and images are still fundamentally sound. In other words, just because we're doing a digital project does not mean that we give up on making good decisions about type and imagery and layout.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to use some css animation, or parallax effect, or background movie as part of your design, please ensure that it enhances your content (not detracting from it).</li>
                    <li>Include some form of social integration as part of your project. You should be displaying a knowledge of the social platform (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Tumblr) that you choose, and you should be showing a senstivity to the medium that shows you're taking advantage of the unique platform features.</li>
                    <li>Users can clearly understand the action that they are supposed to take. Part of the action(s) should involve spreading the message through their network.</li>
