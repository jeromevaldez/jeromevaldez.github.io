                <h1>Javascript</h1>
                <h2>What is javascript?</h2>
                <p>It was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape (an early web browser). It’s the programming language for the web, written specifically for the web. Remember the <a href="in-the-beginning.html#threeLeggedStool">three-legged stool</a>? This leg defines behaviours and interactivity of web pages. Which behaviours you might ask? Here are some examples (but there are many many more:
                </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>onMouseOver behaviours like a hover</li>
                	<li>What happens when a form is filled out incorrectly?</li>
                	<li>How long does a carousel autoplay?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>What it's not (or, how it differs from the back end)</h2>
                <p>Javascript is still considered part of the front-end of a website as opposed to back-end or server-side code. Javascript is a client-side language. The client (in our case the web browser) runs the code that's sent by the server. Languages like PHP or Java or .Net or Ruby on Rails are all server-side languages - they run on the server. Even though it's very rare, a user can disable javascript in the browser and it will prevent it from running.</p>
                <div class="panel panel-info">
                    <div class="panel-heading">
                        <strong>Javascript is not Java</strong>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        It’s not at all related to Java. Sun’s Java language was really hot at the time of Javascript’s invention. So it instead of naming it LiveScript, they named it Javascript instead in order to take advantage of the popularity of Java at the time (1995).
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>All that said, it is still a programming language and uses concepts that should be familiar to those of you who know programming: arrays, loops, strings, variables, etc.</p>
                
                <h2>DOM (the Document Object Model)</h2>
                <p>The document object model is one of the most important things to understand if you are going to work with javascript. Let's break down what the DOM means.</p>
                <h3>D is for Document</h3>
                <p>This is the web page.</p>
                <h3>O is for Object</h3>
                <p>Object are simply the things (duh!). These are elements and components of the document. This includes not only the tags like h1, ul, but also the content within, and even the attributes inside them.</p>
                <h3>M is for Model</h3>
                <p>The Model is the representation of the document as a tree structure, a hierarchy, with parents and children and siblings. It’s a set of terms and standards that describe how to interact with pieces of the web page.</p>
                
                <h2>Events</h2>
                <p>One of the other important things to understand are events. Events are things that happen on the webpage - they are already happening. </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Pages loading</li>
                	<li>Users moving their mouse</li>
                	<li>Users clicking their mouse</li>
                	<li>Users pressing their keyboards</li>
                	<li>Users giving focus (moving the cursor) to a form field</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Events are always happening. You don’t write events.
                You write the event listener or handler. In other words you respond to the events that happen.</p>
                
                <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
                <p>Bootstrap is a web framework with html, css, and javascript all bundled up to make our lives easier. Let's go to the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap website</a> to get started.</p>
                
                <h1>Prototyping Tools and WYSIWYG</h1>
                <p>There are other tools that can make our lives easier when it comes to digital design. They can make interactive websites without requiring us to hand-code html, css and javascript. Here are a few examples.</p>
