                <h1>Social Integration</h1>
                <p>
                    As many of you have already discovered (and have woven into your earlier assignments) the pull of using social media as part of interactive design is very strong. The findability problem of a digital marketing campaign can be partially solved via social networks. So how do we use these social channels to our advantage? And what are the potential pitfalls that we should avoid?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why should I care about using social?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's look back at some of what the industry desires of new IDEA graduates digitally-speaking.
                </p>
                <blockquote>I would say basic HTML/CSS, FTP is mandatory, (including HTML for emails) then wordpress / customizing. Next up would be digital / social media development and integrations (not necessarily content). Then basic PHP, and hosting, name servers, cPanel etcâ€¦</blockquote>
                <blockquote>... jquery, social media integrations/functionality (not content), hosting, phpmyadmin, @records etc.</blockquote>
                
                <h3>
                    Network effects
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It's massive because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>. And if you are creating something for impact, then you can get greater impact via larger networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most major brands have some form of social presence, and want to increase it.

                    Facebook: the 400lb gorilla
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://qz.com/202349/facebook-mobile-user-base-has-crossed-the-1-billion-threshhold/">According to this article, </a> Facebook has crossed the 1 billion user threshold.

                    Twitter: struggling to make money
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Twitter has a user base of about 300 million - which is a lot. But it's been in <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/twitter-growth/">the headlines recently</a> because it's not moving that number up much higher or fast enough.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Instagram: it's owned by Facebook
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Instagram enjoys about 300 million users too. It's owned by Facebook - they bought in April 2012. Much of the Instagram community was wary of the acquisition because they were afraid that Facebook would change what they loved about the app, or worse - shut it down altogether. Neither of those things have happened. The app seems to improve with spinoff apps being launched here and there (<a href="https://hyperlapse.instagram.com/">Hyperlapse</a>, <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/131684343987/boomerang-from-instagram">Boomerang</a>, <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/114416360957/layout-from-instagram">Layout</a>).

                </h1>
                <p>
                    It would be wrong for me to claim a deep knowledge of this social network. Who in this class can speak to Pinterest with an insider point of view?
                </p>

                    Again, I'm at a loss. I haven't tried it.

                <p>
                    I've lost some of the ability to keep up with the pace of new social apps. I'm relying on you to keep me up to speed.

                    Successful social campaigns:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using influencers (and others that we trust/follow) as a key component of your social campaign. e.g. <a href="https://vine.co/v/MQOOJ30jvLn">HP using Robert Ayala on Vine</a>.</li>
                    <li>Almost always costs less for the same amount of money as traditional TV, magazine, newspaper, or radio campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Often emotional.</li>
                    <li>Cute animals, babies doing anything adorable. This is a bit toungue-in-cheek, but seriously seems to work more often than not.</li>
                    <li>Appeals to our built-in: altruism, vanity, FOMO.</li>

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Your job is to create a social campaign, and your main deliverable for the assignment is a website. You need to choose at least one social platform with which to integrate, but feel free to use more than one (just make sure that each one is toughtful and deliberate).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of your deliverables, you might want to also add a write-up or a comp of a social media page that you'd create as part of the campaign. For example, design the Facebook page or Twitter account or Pinterest board or Tumblr page that you'd see being part of your campaign.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Work well in both mobile and desktop. I'll be looking at it in both mediums. Working well means that the navigation works across both mediums, the content is readable, the layout is not broken and looks good.</li>
                    <li>Your concept takes advantage of the unique features/properties of the social platform you've chosen. This means you have to be deliberate and thoughtful about the choices you make for any given platform.</li>
                    <li></li>
