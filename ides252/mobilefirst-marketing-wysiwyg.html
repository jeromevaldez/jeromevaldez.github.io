                <h1>Mobile First</h1>
                <p>Luke Wroblewski's excellent talk on designing for mobile devices. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhnN1CdwvTs&index=4&list=PLMEOqDSoPMSUVk7_CvU8he0yrEU4Wqzf">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br_szl80J1M">Part 2.</a> </p>
                <p>Here are some highlights from his talk:</p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=573">9min28s</a> - Not all screens are created equal. The majority of mobile screens being used and used often are in the 4-5.5in range.</p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=1272">21-26min</a> - 94% of usage is in vertical mode. And half the time, they're using one-handed grip. And most of that time, they're touching the screen with a thumb (vs. other fingers).</p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=1729">29-35min</a> - Using @media-query allows you to take action when you know how large the screen is and what kind of screen it is. You can use media queries to adjust to breakpoints of your design. </p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=2585">43-47min6s</a> - landscape mode usage increases as screen size increases. You can optimize for horizontal orientation too.</p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=3419">57min-1hr4min</a> - Posture. What are people's relationship to the devices physically?</p>
                <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZhnN1CdwvTs?t=4021">1hr07min-1hr9min</a> - How to optimize for one-handed use.</p>
                
                <h1>Marketing Campaign Websites</h1>
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <h3>Digital requires discovery</h3>
                <p>The digital world is hidden. Unlike the physical world which is filled with messages to grab your attention, the digital world usually requires you to discover its messages via some other source first. The physical world can get in your face with campaigns via bus shelters, billboards, street marketing. Compare that to a website that a user first has to be made aware of, then has to actively visit in order to get the message. Because of this quirk of digital marketing, you are almost never dealing with a single marketing medium when you produce interactive designs - you have to consider the campaign across multiple mediums and channels.</p>
                <p>How are users going to discover your site or product? Via another medium like TV or radio or magazine or bus ad or social media?</p>
                
                <h3>So what?</h3>
                <p>This is the big question - what do you want your users to do or feel after they interact with your site or product? The sharper your focus is on this answer, the better your user experiences will become. The common desired outcomes from a digital campaign are:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Provide logistical information</li>
                	<li>Encourage a donation</li>
                	<li>Encourage a purchase</li>
                	<li>Establish brand message</li>
                	<li>Encourage sharing and participation (via social media)</li>
                	<li>Encourage user submissions of content</li>
                	<li>Encourage registrations or sign-ups</li>
                	<li>Encourage contest entry</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>How long will the campaign last?</h3>
                <p>The nature of most marketing campaigns is that they are time-limited. Even the Roll Up The Rim campaign happens once a year. What does this mean to you? You will be forced to make choices to balance the cost of a time-limited run vs. the benefit of a large-and-usually-expensive production.</p>

                <h2>Your next assignment - a marketing campaign website</h2>
                <p>Your client wants a website created for an upcoming marketing campaign.

                <p>I will mark the assignment based on its design on a mobile device.</p>
